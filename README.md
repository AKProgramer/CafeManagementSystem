# Cafe Management System

If you are reading this readme file, it means you want to pull my project. Here, I will try to guide you through the project setup and provide an overview of its structure and functionality.

## Overview

This project is designed with the perspective of two types of users: **ADMIN** and **CUSTOMER**. Although I intended to include a staff module, I didn't add it due to personal reasons. Let's start with a specific description of the project.

## Project Description

In this project, I primarily use panels for navigation instead of forms. There are some additional forms included that I'm not currently utilizing in my project, but they can be employed to alter the user interface of screens.

## Project Execution

When you run this project in Visual Studio, you'll encounter the following:

- **Login and Signup Screens:** These screens provide authentication for both admin and customer access.
- **Customer Module:** Upon running, the customer module will start, which fetches data from SQL Server. SQL Server is used as the database for this project.
- **Admin Module:** This module allows administrators to manage various aspects of the cafe.

### Remaining Work

- **Feedback Panel:** There is remaining work on both the customer and admin sides of the feedback panel.
- **Manage Order Panel:** There is an issue with searching orders.
- **Progress Bar:** Currently, there is a static progress bar that needs to be made dynamic.


Feel free to explore the project further and contribute to its development.
